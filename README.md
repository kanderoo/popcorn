# reel: the command line movie/tv manager

Reel is an ncurses based movie and tv-show manager for linux. With it you can:

* sort movies
* filter moview
* keep viewing stats
* load/view metadata

all from the command line.

## Why?

Reel was designed because I have a lot of movies, and I like to sort, filter, search, and populate metadata from them without the bloat of a graphical application.
